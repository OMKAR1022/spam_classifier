Project: Spam Classifier

Welcome to the Spam Classifier project! This repository contains a Machine Learning solution designed to identify and filter out spam messages using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. With a remarkable accuracy rate of 97.1% and a precision score of 1, this project is geared towards improving your email experience by eliminating unwanted clutter from your inbox.

Key Features:

Advanced Algorithm: The core of this project is the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, meticulously trained to accurately differentiate between spam and legitimate messages.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web interface has been developed to provide a hassle-free experience for users. By simply inputting a message, you can swiftly determine whether it's spam or not.
Ongoing Refinement: This project is not static; continuous enhancements and optimizations are in progress to ensure it remains at the forefront of spam detection technology.
